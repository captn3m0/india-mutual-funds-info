# Mutual Funds Information

:warning: This repository used to be at `captn3m0/kuvera-mutual-funds-lookup`. Since now it contains more than just the Kuvera Identifiers, I've renamed it to `captn3m0/india-mutual-funds-info`.

SEBI Mutual Fund Identifiers, and SSD parsing are WIP. Stay tuned. All data will be published in CSV/SQLite/HTTP-API formats, with standard identifiers (ISINs/SEBI-IDs).

## Mutual Funds Information

`amfi_funds.csv` contains AMC_ID,MF_ID,MF_NAME. All identifiers are AMFI Identifiers here.

## Kuvera

Simple dataset containing a mapping between Kuvera's Mutual Fund IDs and their ISINs.
Data is contained in `data.csv`.

## LFS

This repo uses Git LFS to store SSD XMLs.
